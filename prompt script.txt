🚀 Running the Tests
✅ Prerequisites
poetry

These tests use Poetry for dependency management. If you don’t have it installed, run the following command (only once):

pip install poetry
GCP Permissions

The tests call the overseer service in the sandbox environment, so you need appropriate permissions:

🔹 Overseer Sandbox Service Account Run the following command to generate temporary credentials:

gcloud iam service-accounts keys create $HOME/.config/gcloud/overseer-sandbox.json --iam-account overseer-run-sandbox@felix-technologies.iam.gserviceaccount.com
This creates a key that is valid for 24 hours. Then, export it as your active credentials:

export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="$HOME/.config/gcloud/overseer-sandbox.json"
⚠️ Important: This will override your current credentials. Be sure to restore your original credentials after running the tests.

▶️ First-time Setup
Install dependencies:

poetry install
✅ Manually Running Integration Tests
To run a specific test, use the following pattern:

poetry run python test_trigger_order.py

After run I need to save this ID and use it in playwright-framework-test/src/fixtures/test-data.ts in this variables
paymentReviewUrl: 'https://test.pay.felixpago.com/{orderID}/payment/review?overseer=true',
  successUrlPattern: 'https://test.pay.felixpago.com/{orderID}/payment/status?status=APPROVED&overseer=true',

  create the neccesary connections and setup to acomplish this task
